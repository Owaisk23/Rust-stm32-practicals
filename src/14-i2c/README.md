# I2C

We just saw the serial communication protocol. It's a widely used protocol because it's very
simple and this simplicity makes it easy to implement on top of other protocols like Bluetooth and
USB.

However, it's simplicity is also a downside. More elaborated data exchanges, like reading a digital
sensor, would require the sensor vendor to come up with another protocol on top of it.

(Un)Luckily for us, there are *plenty* of other communication protocols in the embedded space. Some
of them are widely used in digital sensors.

The F3 board we are using has three motion sensors in it: an accelerometer, a magnetometer and
gyroscope. The accelerometer and magnetometer are packaged in a single component and can be accessed
via an I2C bus.

I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit and is a *synchronous* *serial* communication protocol. It
uses two lines to exchange data: a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). Because a clock line is
used to synchronize the communication, this is a *synchronous* protocol.

This protocol uses a *master* *slave* model where the master is the device that *starts* and
drives the communication with a slave device. Several devices, both masters and slaves, can be
connected to the same bus at the same time. A master device can communicate with a specific slave
device by first broadcasting its *address* to the bus. This address can be 7 bits or 10 bits long.
Once a master has *started* a communication with a slave, no other device can make use of the bus
until the master *stops* the communication.

The clock line determines how fast data can be exchanged and it usually operates at a frequency of
100 KHz (standard mode) or 400 KHz (fast mode).
