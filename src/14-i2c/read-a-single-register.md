# Read a single register

Let's put all that theory into practice!

Just like with the USART peripheral, I've taken care of initializing everything before you reach
`main` so you'll only have to deal with the following registers:

- `CR2`. Control register 2.
- `ISR`. Interrupt and status register.
- `TXDR`. Transmit data register.
- `RXDR`. Receive data register.

These registers are documented in the following section of the Reference Manual:

> Section 28.7 I2C registers - Page 873 - Reference Manual

We'll be using the `I2C1` peripheral in conjunction with pins `PB6` (`SCL`) and `PB7` (`SDA`).

You won't have to wire anything this time because the sensor is on the board and it's already
connected to the microcontroller. However, I would recommend that you disconnect the serial /
Bluetooth module from the F3 to make it easier to manipulate. Later on, we'll be moving the board
around quite a bit.

Your task is to write a program that reads the contents of the magnetometer's `IRA_REG_M` register.
This register is read only and always contains the value `0b01001000`.

The microcontroller will be taking the role of the I2C master and the magnetometer inside the
LSM303DLHC will be the I2C slave.

Here's the starter code. You'll have to implement the `TODO`s.

``` rust
{{#include src/main.rs}}
```

To give you some extra help, these are the exact bitfields you'll be working with:

- `CR2`: `SADD1`, `RD_WRN`, `NBYTES`, `START`, `AUTOEND`
- `ISR`: `TXIS`, `RXNE`, `TC`
- `TXDR`: `TXDATA`
- `RXDR`: `RXDATA`
