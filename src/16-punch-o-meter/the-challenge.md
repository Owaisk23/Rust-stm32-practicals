# The challenge

To keep things simple, we'll measure the acceleration only in the X axis while the board remains
horizontal. That way we won't have to deal with subtracting that *fictitious* `1g` we observed
before which would be hard because that `1g` could have X Y Z components depending on how the board
is oriented.

Here's what the punch-o-meter must do:

- By default, the app is not "observing" the acceleration of the board.
- When a significant X acceleration is detected (i.e. the acceleration goes above some threshold),
  the app should start a new measurement.
- During that measurement interval, the app should keep track of the maximum acceleration observed
- After the measurement interval ends, the app must report the maximum acceleration observed. You
  can report the value using the `iprintln` macro.

Give it a try and let me know how hard you can punch `;-)`.
