# Hardware/knowledge requirements

The only knowledge requirement to read this book is to know *some* Rust. It's
hard for me to quantify *some* but at least I can tell you that you don't need
to fully grok generics but you do need to know how to *use* closures. You also
need to be familiar with the idioms of the [2018 edition], in particular with
the fact that `extern crate` is not necessary in the 2018 edition.

Also, to follow this material you'll need the following hardware:

(Some components are optional but recommended)

- A [STM32F3DISCOVERY] board.

[STM32F3DISCOVERY]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html

(You can purchase this board from "big" [electronics][0] [suppliers][1] or from [e-commerce][2]
[sites][3])

- OPTIONAL. A **3.3V** USB <-> Serial module. [This particular model][sparkfun] will be used
  throughout this material but you can use any other model as long as it operates at 3.3V.

(The (Chinese) CH340G module, which you can buy [e-commerce][4] sites, works too and it's probably
cheaper for you to get)

- OPTIONAL. A HC-05 Bluetooth module (with headers!). A HC-06 would work too.

(As with other Chinese parts, you pretty much can only find these on [e-commerce][5] [sites][6].
(US) Electronics suppliers don't usually stock these for some reason)

- Two mini-B USB cables. One is required to make the STM32F3DISCOVERY board work. The other is only
  required if you have the Serial <-> USB module. Make sure that the cables both
  support data transfer as some cables only support charging devices.

> **NOTE** These are **not** the USB cables that ship with pretty much every Android phone; those
> are *micro* USB cables. Make sure you have the right thing!

- MOSTLY OPTIONAL. 5 female to female, 4 male to female and 1 Male to Male *jumper* (AKA Dupont)
  wires. You'll *very likely* need one female to female to get ITM working. The other wires are only
  needed if you'll be using the USB <-> Serial and Bluetooth modules.

(You can get these from electronics [suppliers][7] or from [e-commerce][8] [sites][9])

> **FAQ**: Wait, why do I need this specific hardware?

It makes my life and yours much easier.

The material is much, much more approachable if we don't have to worry about hardware differences.
Trust me on this one.

> **FAQ**: Can I follow this material with a different development board?

Maybe? It depends mainly on two things: your previous experience with microcontrollers and/or
whether there already exists a high level crate, like the [`f3`], for your development board
somewhere.

[`f3`]: https://docs.rs/f3

With a different development board, this text would lose most if not all its beginner friendliness
and "easy to follow"-ness, IMO.

If you have a different development board and you don't consider yourself a total beginner, you are
better off starting with the [quickstart] project template.
