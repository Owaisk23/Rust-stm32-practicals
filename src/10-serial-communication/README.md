Nah, don't worry. This connector, the DE-9, went out of fashion on PCs quite some time ago; it got
replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB). We won't be dealing with the DE-9 connector itself but
with the communication protocol that this cable is/was usually used for.

So what's this [*serial communication*][ASC]? It's an *asynchronous* communication protocol where two
devices exchange data *serially*, as in one bit at a time, using two data lines (plus a common
ground). The protocol is asynchronous in the sense that neither of the shared lines carries a clock
signal. Instead both parties must agree on how fast data will be sent along the wire *before* the
communication occurs. This protocol allows *duplex* communication as data can be sent from A to B
and from B to A simultaneously.

We'll be using this protocol to exchange data between the microcontroller and your laptop. In
contrast to the ITM protocol we have used before, with the serial communication protocol you can
send data from your laptop to the microcontroller.

The next practical question you probably want to ask is: How fast can we send data through this
protocol?

This protocol works with frames. Each frame has one *start* bit, 5 to 9 bits of payload (data) and 1
to 2 *stop bits*. The speed of the protocol is known as *baud rate* and it's quoted in bits per
second (bps). Common baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bps.

To actually answer the question: With a common configuration of 1 start bit, 8 bits of data, 1
stop bit and a baud rate of 115200 bps one can, in theory, send 11,520 frames per second. Since each
one frame carries a byte of data that results in a data rate of 11.52 KB/s. In practice, the data
rate will probably be lower because of processing times on the slower side of the communication (the
microcontroller).

Today's laptops/PCs don't support the serial communication protocol. So you can't directly connect
your laptop to the microcontroller. But that's where the serial module comes in. This module will
sit between the two and expose a serial interface to the microcontroller and an USB interface to
your laptop. The microcontroller will see your laptop as another serial device and your laptop
will see the microcontroller as a virtual serial device.

Now, let's get familiar with the serial module and the serial communication tools that your OS
offers. Pick a route:
