# Windows tooling

Before plugging the Serial module, run the following command on the terminal:

``` console
$ mode
```

It will print a list of devices that are connected to your laptop. The ones that start with `COM` in
their names are serial devices. This is the kind of device we'll be working with. Take note of all
the `COM` *ports* `mode` outputs *before* plugging the serial module.

Now, plug the Serial module and run the `mode` command again. You should see a new `COM` port appear
on the list. That's the COM port assigned to the serial module.

Now launch `putty`. A GUI will pop out.

On the starter screen, which should have the "Session" category open, pick "Serial" as the
"Connection type". On the "Serial line" field enter the `COM` device you got on the previous step,
for example `COM3`.

Next, pick the "Connection/Serial" category from the menu on the left. On this new view, make sure
that the serial port is configured as follows:

- "Speed (baud)": 115200
- "Data bits": 8
- "Stop bits": 1
- "Parity": None
- "Flow control": None

Finally, click the Open button. A console will show up now:

If you type on this console, the TX (red) LED on the Serial module should blink. Each key stroke
should make the LED blink once. Note that the console won't echo back what you type so the screen
will remain blank.
