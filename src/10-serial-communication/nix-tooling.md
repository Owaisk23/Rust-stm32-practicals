# *nix tooling

Connect the serial module to your laptop and let's find out what name the OS assigned to it.

> **NOTE** On macs, the USB device will named like this: `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`. You won't
> find it using `dmesg`, instead use `ls -l /dev | grep cu.usb` and adjust the following 
> commands accordingly!

``` console
$ dmesg | grep -i tty
(..)
[  +0.000155] usb 3-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

But what's this `ttyUSB0` thing? It's a file of course! Everything is a file in *nix:

``` console
$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
crw-rw-rw- 1 root uucp 188, 0 Oct 27 00:00 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

> **NOTE** if the permissions above is `crw-rw----`, the udev rules have not been set correctly
> see [udev rules](../03-setup/linux.html#udev-rules)

You can send out data by simply writing to this file:

``` console
$ echo 'Hello, world!' > /dev/ttyUSB0
```

You should see the TX (red) LED on the serial module blink, just once and very fast!

## minicom

Dealing with serial devices using `echo` is far from ergonomic. So, we'll use the program `minicom`
to interact with the serial device using the keyboard.

We must configure `minicom` before we use it. There are quite a few ways to do that but we'll use a
`.minirc.dfl` file in the home directory. Create a file in `~/.minirc.dfl` with the following
contents:

``` console
$ cat ~/.minirc.dfl
pu baudrate 115200
pu bits 8
pu parity N
pu stopbits 1
pu rtscts No
pu xonxoff No
```

> **NOTE** Make sure this file ends in a newline! Otherwise, `minicom` will fail to read it.

That file should be straightforward to read (except for the last two lines), but nonetheless let's
go over it line by line:

- `pu baudrate 115200`. Sets baud rate to 115200 bps.
- `pu bits 8`. 8 bits per frame.
- `pu parity N`. No parity check.
- `pu stopbits 1`. 1 stop bit.
- `pu rtscts No`. No hardware control flow.
- `pu xonxoff No`. No software control flow.

Once that's in place. We can launch `minicom`

``` console
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```

This tells `minicom` to open the serial device at `/dev/ttyUSB0` and set its baud rate to 115200.
A text-based user interface (TUI) will pop out.

You can now send data using the keyboard! Go ahead and type something. Note that the TUI *won't*
echo back what you type but you'll see TX (red) LED on the serial module blink with each keystroke.

## `minicom` commands

`minicom` exposes commands via keyboard shortcuts. On Linux, the shortcuts start with `Ctrl+A`. On
mac, the shortcuts start with the `Meta` key. Some useful commands below:

- `Ctrl+A` + `Z`. Minicom Command Summary
- `Ctrl+A` + `C`. Clear the screen
- `Ctrl+A` + `X`. Exit and reset
- `Ctrl+A` + `Q`. Quit with no reset

> **NOTE** mac users: In the above commands, replace `Ctrl+A` with `Meta`.
