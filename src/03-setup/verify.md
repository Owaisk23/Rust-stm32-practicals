# Verify the installation

Let's verify that all the tools were installed correctly.

## Linux only

### Verify permissions

Connect the F3 to your laptop using an USB cable. Be sure to connect the cable to the "USB ST-LINK"
port, the USB port in the center of the edge of the board.

The F3 should now appear as a USB device (file) in `/dev/bus/usb`. Let's find out how it got
enumerated:

``` console
$ lsusb | grep -i stm
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1
$ # ^^^        ^^^
```

In my case, the F3 got connected to the bus #3 and got enumerated as the device #4. This means the
file `/dev/bus/usb/003/004` *is* the F3. Let's check its permissions:

``` console
$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/003/004
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 189, 20 Sep 13 00:00 /dev/bus/usb/003/004
```

The permissions should be `crw-rw-rw-`. If it's not ... then check your [udev
rules] and try re-loading them with:

[udev rules]: linux.md#udev-rules

``` console
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Now let's repeat the procedure for the Serial module.

Unplug the F3 and plug the Serial module. Now, figure out what's its associated file:

``` console
$ lsusb | grep -i ft232
Bus 003 Device 005: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
```

In my case, it's the `/dev/bus/usb/003/005`. Now, check its permissions:

``` console
$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/003/005
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 21 Sep 13 00:00 /dev/bus/usb/003/005
```

As before, the permissions should be `crw-rw-rw-`.

## All

### First OpenOCD connection

First, connect the F3 to your laptop using an USB cable. Connect the cable to the USB port in the
center of edge of the board, the one that's labeled "USB ST-LINK".

Two *red* LEDs should turn on right after connecting the USB cable to the board.

Next, run this command:

``` console
$ # *nix
$ openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg

$ # Windows
$ # NOTE cygwin users have reported problems with the -s flag. If you run into
$ # that you can call openocd from the `C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts` directory
$ openocd -s C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

> **NOTE** Windows users: `C:\OpenOCD` is the directory where you installed OpenOCD to.

> **IMPORTANT** There is more than one hardware revision of the STM32F3DISCOVERY board. For older
> revisions, you'll need to change the "interface" argument to `-f interface/stlink-v2.cfg` (note:
> no `-1` at the end). Alternatively, older revisions can use `-f board/stm32f3discovery.cfg`
> instead of `-f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg`.

You should see output like this:

``` console

(If you don't ... then check the [general troubleshooting] instructions.)

`openocd` will block the terminal. That's fine.

Also, one of the red LEDs, the one closest to the USB port, should start oscillating between red
light and green light.

That's it! It works. You can now close/kill `openocd`.
