# Send a string

The next task will be to send a whole string from the micro to your laptop.

I want you to send the string `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."` from the micro to
your laptop.

It's your turn to write the program.

Execute your program inside the debugger, statement by statement. What do you see?

Then execute the program again but in *one go* using the `continue` command. What happens this time?

Finally, build the program in *release* mode and, again, run it one go. What happens this time?
