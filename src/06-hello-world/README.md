# Hello, world!

Just a little more of helpful magic before we start doing low level stuff.

Blinking an LED is like the "Hello, world" of the embedded world.

But in this section, we'll run a proper "Hello, world" program that prints stuff to your laptop
console.

Go to the `06-hello-world` directory. There's some starter code in it:

``` rust
{{#include src/main.rs}}
```

The `iprintln` macro will format messages and output them to the microcontroller's *ITM*. ITM stands
for Instrumentation Trace Macrocell and it's a communication protocol on top of SWD (Serial Wire
Debug) which can be used to send messages from the microcontroller to the debugging host. This
communication is only *one way*: the debugging host can't send data to the microcontroller.

OpenOCD, which is managing the debug session, can receive data sent through this ITM *channel* and
redirect it to a file.

The ITM protocol works with *frames* (you can think of them as Ethernet frames). Each frame has a
header and a variable length payload. OpenOCD will receive these frames and write them directly to a
file without parsing them. So, if the microntroller sends the string "Hello, world!" using the
`iprintln` macro, OpenOCD's output file won't exactly contain that string.

To retrieve the original string, OpenOCD's output file will have to be parsed. We'll use the
`itmdump` program to perform the parsing as new data arrives.

You should have already installed the `itmdump` program during the [installation chapter].

[installation chapter]: ../03-setup/index.html#itmdump

In a new terminal, run this command inside the `/tmp` directory, if you are using a *nix OS, or from
within the `%TEMP%` directory, if you are running Windows. This should be the same directory from
where you are running OpenOCD.

> **NOTE** It's very important that both `itmdump` and `openocd` are running
from the same directory!

``` console
$ # itmdump terminal

$ # *nix
$ cd /tmp && touch itm.txt

$ # Windows
$ cd %TEMP% && type nul >> itm.txt

$ # both
$ itmdump -F -f itm.txt
```

This command will block as `itmdump` is now watching the `itm.txt` file. Leave this terminal open.

Alright. Now, let's build the starter code and flash it into the microcontroller.

To avoid passing the `--target thumbv7em-none-eabihf` flag to every Cargo invocation we can set a
default target in .cargo/config:

``` diff
 [target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf]
 runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -x openocd.gdb"
 rustflags = [
   "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
 ]

+[build]
+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
```

Now if `--target` is not specified Cargo will assume that the target is `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`.

``` console
$ cargo run
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/hello-world...done.

10          let mut itm = aux6::init();
```

Note that there's a `openocd.gdb` at the root of the Cargo project. It's pretty similar to the one we
used in the previous section.

Before we execute the `iprintln!` statement. We have to instruct OpenOCD to redirect the ITM output
into the same file that `itmdump` is watching.

```
(gdb) # globally enable the ITM and redirect all output to itm.txt
(gdb) monitor tpiu config internal itm.txt uart off 8000000

(gdb) # enable the ITM port 0
(gdb) monitor itm port 0 on
```

All should be ready! Now execute the `iprintln!` statement.

```
(gdb) next
12          iprintln!(&mut itm.stim[0], "Hello, world!");

(gdb) next
14          loop {}
```

You should see some output in the `itmdump` terminal:

``` console
$ itmdump -F -f itm.txt
(..)
Hello, world!
```

Awesome, right? Feel free to use `iprintln` as a logging tool in the coming sections.

Next: That's not all! The `iprint!` macros are not the only thing that uses the ITM. `:-)`
