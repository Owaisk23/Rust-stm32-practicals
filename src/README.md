# Discovery

> Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust]!

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

This book is an introductory course on microcontroller-based embedded systems that uses Rust as the
teaching language rather than the usual C/C++.

## Scope

The following topics will be covered (eventually, I hope):

- How to write, build, flash and debug an "embedded" (Rust) program.

- Functionality ("peripherals") commonly found in microcontrollers: Digital input and output, Pulse
  Width Modulation (PWM), Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), common communication protocols like
  Serial, I2C and SPI, etc.

- Multitasking concepts: cooperative vs preemptive multitasking, interrupts, schedulers, etc.

- Control systems concepts: sensors, calibration, digital filters, actuators, open loop control,
  closed loop control, etc.

## Approach

- Beginner friendly. No previous experience with microcontrollers or embedded systems is required.

- Hands on. Plenty of exercises to put the theory into practice. *You* will be doing most of the
  work here.

- Tool centered. We'll make plenty use of tooling to ease development. "Real" debugging, with GDB,
  and logging will be introduced early on. Using LEDs as a debugging mechanism has no place here.

## Non-goals

What's out of scope for this book:

- Teaching Rust. There's plenty of material on that topic already. We'll focus on microcontrollers
  and embedded systems.

- Being a comprehensive text about electric circuit theory or electronics. We'll just cover the
  minimum required to understand how some devices work.

- Covering Rustic, low level details. We won't be talking about linker scripts, the boot process or
  how to glue those two into a minimally working Rust program.

Also I don't intend to port this material to other development boards; this book will make exclusive
use of the STM32F3DISCOVERY development board.

Many thanks to [integer 32](http://integer32.com/) for sponsoring me to work on this book! Please
give them lots of work (they do Rust consulting!) so they'll have no choice but to hire more
Rustaceans <3.
