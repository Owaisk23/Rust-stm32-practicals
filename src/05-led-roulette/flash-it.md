# Flash it

Flashing is the process of moving our program into the microcontroller's (persistent) memory. Once
flashed, the microcontroller will execute the flashed program every time it is powered on.

In this case, our `led-roulette` program will be the *only* program in the microcontroller memory.
By this I mean that there's nothing else running on the microcontroller: no OS, no "daemon",
nothing. `led-roulette` has full control over the device.

Onto the actual flashing. First thing we need is to do is launch OpenOCD. We did that in the
previous section but this time we'll run the command inside a temporary directory (`/tmp` on *nix;
`%TEMP%` on Windows).

Make sure the F3 is connected to your laptop and run the following commands on a new terminal.

``` console
$ # *nix
$ cd /tmp

$ # Windows
$ cd %TEMP%

$ # Windows: remember that you need an extra `-s %PATH_TO_OPENOCD%\share\scripts`
$ openocd \
  -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg \
  -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

> **NOTE** Older revisions of the board need to pass slightly different arguments to
> `openocd`. Review [this section] for the details.

[this section]: ../03-setup/verify.md#first-openocd-connection

The program will block; leave that terminal open.

Now it's a good time to explain what this command is actually doing.

I mentioned that the F3 actually has two microcontrollers. One of them is used as a
programmer/debugger. The part of the board that's used as a programmer is called ST-LINK (that's what
STMicroelectronics decided to call it). This ST-LINK is connected to the target microcontroller
using a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface (this interface is an ARM standard so you'll run into it
when dealing with other Cortex-M based microcontrollers). This SWD interface can be used to flash
and debug a microcontroller. The ST-LINK is connected to the "USB ST-LINK" port and will appear as
a USB device when you connect the F3 to your laptop.

As for OpenOCD, it's software that provides some services like a *GDB server* on top of USB
devices that expose a debugging protocol like SWD or JTAG.

Onto the actual command: those `.cfg` files we are using instruct OpenOCD to look for a ST-LINK USB
device (`interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg`) and to expect a STM32F3XX microcontroller
(`target/stm32f3x.cfg`) to be connected to the ST-LINK.

The OpenOCD output looks like this:

``` console

```

The "6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints" part indicates the debugging features the processor has
available.

Leave that `openocd` process running, and open a new terminal. Make sure that you are inside the project's `src/05-led-roulette/` directory.

I mentioned that OpenOCD provides a GDB server so let's connect to that right now:

``` console
$ <gdb> -q target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...done.
(gdb)
```

**NOTE**: `<gdb>` represents a GDB program capable of debugging ARM binaries.
This could be `arm-none-eabi-gdb`, `gdb-multiarch` or `gdb` depending on your
system -- you may have to try all three.

This only opens a GDB shell. To actually connect to the OpenOCD GDB server, use the following
command within the GDB shell:

```
(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
```

**NOTE**: If you are getting errors like `undefined debug reason 7 - target needs reset`, you can try running `monitor reset halt` as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38994596/reason-7-target-needs-reset-unreliable-debugging-setup).

**NOTE**: If the debugger is still not connecting to the OpenOCD server, then you may need to try using `arm-none-eabi-gdb` instead of the `gdb` command, as described above.

By default OpenOCD's GDB server listens on TCP port 3333 (localhost). This command is connecting to
that port.

After entering this command, you'll see new output in the OpenOCD terminal:

``` diff
 Info : stm32f3x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints
+Info : accepting 'gdb' connection on tcp/3333
+Info : device id = 0x10036422
+Info : flash size = 256kbytes
```

Almost there. To flash the device, we'll use the `load` command inside the GDB shell:

```
(gdb) load
Loading section .vector_table, size 0x188 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .text, size 0x38a lma 0x8000188
Loading section .rodata, size 0x8 lma 0x8000514
Start address 0x8000188, load size 1306
Transfer rate: 6 KB/sec, 435 bytes/write.
```

And that's it. You'll also see new output in the OpenOCD terminal.

``` diff

Our program is loaded, let's debug it!
